        <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
        <h3><em>YELLOW</em></h3>

        <p>That perfect shade of yellow essentialises the creamy dairy goodness of yellow cows. Yellow risotto is a great symbol of <strong>HOPE</strong> and <strong>YOLK.</strong></p>

        <h3><em>GREEN</em></h3>
        <p>The upright Thyme leaves, sticking out all around the stem, reminds you that life is but a carousel. The grass will always be greener on the <em>Other</em> side. And cows yellower.</p>

        <h3><em>RED</em></h3>
        <p>That <em>scallop</em>, glistening with the colour of the inimitable <em>Dong Po Rou</em>, is the most huat of all. In its cascading gradient of RED, our primal instincts are alerted. And we ravage the <strong><em> INSTANT POT MUSHROOM RISOTTO</em></strong> </p>
        <p></p>
